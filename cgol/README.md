# Pratt parser in JavaScript 

## Overview

I implemented the Pratt parser from the first referenced article in JavaScript.

## Description

There are numbered HTML files which you can open in a browser to test the 
associated JavaScript implementation of the parser. The implementations
are different, the first file follows closely the material presented in the
article and is then gradually modified towards the last version.

## References

In this implementation of Pratt's parser I made use of the material presented in these articles:
